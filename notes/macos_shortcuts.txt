Once you're inside a folder, you can move around in the same way, but you can also go back up to the enclosing folder; the one you came from. To do this, press Command-up arrow. So, in the screenshot above, I could press Command-down arrow to enter the Archives folder, browse for something, then press Command-up arrow to get back where I started.

It's important to know that there are lots of keyboard shortcuts available once you've selected an item. You can copy it by pressing Command-C; you may then want to move into a folder and paste the file, using Command-V, or paste it into an email message using the same keyboard shortcut. You can duplicate an item with Command-D; print it with Command-P; make an alias with Command-Control-A (or Command-L, in versions of macOS prior to Mojave); or see information about the item with Command-I.
